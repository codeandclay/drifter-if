# Drifter IF

WIP: The beginnings of a text adventure framework.

## Notes

Things are the props and scenery.

For anything to happen in the world, an action has to run.

Actions are run by events. They can be initialized with subjects.

An event is fired. An event runs one or more actions.

Events are fired by the user, fired by other events, or scheduled.

An event can run other events around its action/s.
