# Drifter IF

WIP: The beggings of a text adventure framework.

## Notes

If items are the props and scenery, events and actions are the on-stage movement.

For anything to happen in the world, an action has to run.

Actions are run by events.

An event is fired. An event runs one or more actions.

Events are fired by the user, fired by other events, or scheduled.

An event can run other events around its action/s.
